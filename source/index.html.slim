		h1 Profile
		p Building software that people actually like to use is what gets me going. With nearly 10 years experience I've delivered solid products for the Telecoms, Retail and Charity sectors. I've led teams to build everything from Business Intelligence Platforms, custom Content Management Systems, Online Stores to Browser Plugins. From day one I've been an agile practitioner, whether it's Scrum or Kanban, Lean, BDD, outside-in, pair-programming, you name it, I've been doing it for years. I've usually led from the front but I value project consistency over personal preferences so am equally comfortable working alone or slotting into an existing team.

		p: em White-labelled fundraising SAAS product for charities. Using a cross-browser plugin charities can leverage their supporter&apos;s online spending to raise money. 

		p I was responsible for the creation of a website that allowed charities and supporters to sign up and a cross-browser plugin that tracked their purchases. Any cashback raised is automatically sent to the supporter&apos;s charity. Participating retailers are highlighted in google to encourage supporters to use them.

		p Responsible for architecture of CMS for telecommunications articles. Created publishing workflow, leveraged webdav to allow ms-word to be used to edit articles. Users can hit save in word, refresh their browser and instantly preview exactly how their article will be rendered on the site. Search powered by autonomy. Due to unreliability of autonomy wrote a layer that ensured that articles were added/removed correctly even if autonomy initially failed.

		p Facilitated move from svn to git, found git particularly useful with feature branches and in pairing environment. Introduced promiscuous pairing, saw instant increase in velocity, quality and team/developer satisfaction. Encouraged BDD to allow better match between code and business domain. Used DDD rather than n-tier architecture resulting in far simpler code base that's far easier to understand. Created active-collections and butler open source projects to allow rapid development of backend. Used ruby and capistrano to create deployment script that managed automatic upgrade of database (a la active-record migrations) and deployment to tomcat(s). Facilitated move from windows environment to ubuntu and gained associated improvements in speed, reliability and number of available developer tools.

		p BI portal for mobile phone data. Created a strategy with business to incrementally migrate existing site to new architecture based on WBIS (see below). Releases made after migrating each section of site. New architecture built on top of olap4j. Similar to jdbc, this allowed a switch from mondrian to ms analysis services part way through the project when management decided to invest in the faster engine. Introduced clover as mechanism for effectively tracking test coverage and to identify areas of code base that were overly complex.

		.position Tech lead
		a.project-link href="http://www.informatandm.com/wbis" www.informatandm.com\/wbis

		p Determined requirements with business for a new BI portal focused on broadband data. Introduced scrum to manage the development of the project in an iterative style. Architected solution on top of mondrian OLAP engine. Used restful urls so that any BI query could be represented in a human readable format. All data was provided by external sources and was generally noisy. It would be provided at different levels of aggregation and would often conflict. As the BI engine required normalised data the DB developer and I built algorithms that would resolve conflicts and backfill data to the bottom of the hierarchy.

		p Introduced maven across all projects for build management, this resolved the issue of projects having inconsistent build scripts and environment requirements. Previously startup time for developers moving to projects had been considerable. Introduced continuum for continuous integration. Introduced EasyMock as a tool to allow effective mocking so that TDD could be applied effectively.
