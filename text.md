# Profile

Building software that people actually like to use is what gets me going. I love that the software industry is so young and that there's so much room for exploration and innovation. I'm fascinated by the ways in which the interactions between people within an organisation seemingly have a much greater impact on successful software delivery than the technologies involved. Currently interested in how lean principles fit with scrum and how they apply on a larger scale to the organisation.

## Project Manager
I've been an agile proponent since the start of my career. As CTO at Nutshell Development in 2004 I managed projects using the venerable XPlanner before moving to a more formal Scrum process at Informa in 2005. After years of Scrum I began to favour the Kanban approach (particularly for stable teams). Kanban has been my go to process whilst CTO at Myschooldirect and Give4Sure. It's allowed me to retain the quality of a formal process whilst being able to repidly change direction.

## Developer
As with my management style I've always followed agile principles. I began unit testing code in 2005 moving to test driven the following year. After years of java cucumber and rspec were 2 of the things that appealed most about a move to Ruby on Rails. Currently I favour an outside-in style, growing the code organically

## 2008 - Intelligence Centre 2 - Tech lead
### www.informatandm.com/ic

Responsible for architecture of CMS for telecommunications articles. Created publishing workflow, leveraged webdav to allow ms-word to be used to edit articles. Users can hit save in word, refresh their browser and instantly preview exactly how their article will be rendered on the site. Search powered by autonomy. Due to unreliability of autonomy wrote a layer that ensured that articles were added/removed correctly even if autonomy initially failed.

Facilitated move from svn to git, found git particularly useful with feature branches and in pairing environment. Introduced promiscuous pairing, saw instant increase in velocity, quality and team/developer satisfaction. Encouraged BDD to allow better match between code and business domain. Used DDD rather than n-tier architecture resulting in far simpler code base that's far easier to understand. Created active-collections and butler open source projects to allow rapid development of backend. Used ruby and capistrano to create deployment script that managed automatic upgrade of database (a la active-record migrations) and deployment to tomcat(s). Facilitated move from windows environment to ubuntu and gained associated improvements in speed, reliability and number of available developer tools.

Java - Tapestry/Spring/JPA(hibernate)

## 2007 - WCIS - Tech lead
### www.informatandm.com/about/wcis

BI portal for mobile phone data. Created a strategy with business to incrementally migrate existing site to new architecture based on WBIS (see below). Releases made after migrating each section of site. New architecture built on top of olap4j. Similar to jdbc, this allowed a switch from mondrian to ms analysis services part way through the project when management decided to invest in the faster engine. Introduced clover as mechanism for effectively tracking test coverage and to identify areas of code base that were overly complex.

Java - Tapestry/Spring/JPA(hibernate)

## 2006 - WBIS - Tech lead
### www.informatandm.com/wbis

Determined requirements with business for a new BI portal focused on broadband data. Introduced scrum to manage the development of the project in an iterative style. Architected solution on top of mondrian OLAP engine. Used restful urls so that any BI query could be represented in a human readable format. All data was provided by external sources and was generally noisy. It would be provided at different levels of aggregation and would often conflict. As the BI engine required normalised data the DB developer and I built algorithms that would resolve conflicts and backfill data to the bottom of the hierarchy.

Introduced maven across all projects for build management, this resolved the issue of projects having inconsistent build scripts and environment requirements. Previously startup time for developers moving to projects had been considerable. Introduced continuum for continuous integration. Introduced EasyMock as a tool to allow effective mocking so that TDD could be applied effectively.

Java - Tapestry/Spring/JPA(hibernate)

## 2005 - NEWT - Teah lead

Conference management tool. Speaker/schedule management, mailshots, attendee bookings, marketing website generation. Responsible for developing speaker management and tool for creating the marketing website. Introduced xplanner to resolve issue with business changing requirements at point of delivery.

Java - JSF/Spring/Hibernate

Complete lifecycle of projects. Project management, requirements capture from external clients, architected/implemented solutions, deployment, maintenance.

Java - JSF/Spring/JDO

## 2004 - Runtime Collective - Contractor

Migrating content/workflows to Applaws CMS for county councils.

Java - Custom stack based on servlets
